## 📚 Step-by-Step Setup Guide


### 📖 Prepare your environment (skip if you only need local deployment)

#### 1️⃣ Prepare GitHub Account

- Make sure you have your own Github Account
---

#### 2️⃣ Create Your GitHub Repository

- Clone this repository and copy the source code to your new repository
---

#### 3️⃣ Prepare Azure Account

- Make sure you have your own Azure Account with enough permissions (Sign Up for a Free Trial, if you don't have one)
---

#### 4️⃣ Customize Source Code & GitHub Workflows

- Edit "**.github/workflows/deploy-*.yaml**" files: replace "**master**" with the name of your main branch (you can change default main branch name in github repository settings)
- Edit "**k8s/prod/ingress-srv.yaml**" file: replace "**skycomposer.net**" with the name of your registered domain (see **Step 5** and section [Azure Production Environment](#azure-production-environment-with-terraform--skaffold) for more details)
---

#### 5️⃣ Register Your Domain
- You need a registered domain to provide TLS connection with trusted Certificate Authority.
- For more details on setting up TLS on AKS Ingress with LetsEncrypt see this article: https://medium.com/@jainchirag8001/tls-on-aks-ingress-with-letsencrypt-f42d65725a3
- This article will show you how to configure TLS on AKS with LetsEncrypt for any registered domain, including AWS Route 53.
- Make sure that you know how to create Hosted Zone and Record A for your domain provider.
- For more details, see the section [Azure Production Environment](#azure-production-environment-with-terraform--skaffold)
---



## ⚙️ Local Kubernetes Environment Setup with Skaffold:

1. Create local Kubernetes Cluster. If you have Docker Desktop, just go to Settings -> Kubernetes -> Enable Kubernetes ->  Apply & Restart 

2. Switch context to local Kubernetes Cluster. If you have Docker Desktop, just go to Kubernetes Context and select "docker-desktop"

3. create `.env.local` file in `env` folder and provide the following parameters:

```
CONTAINER_REGISTRY="moviebets.azurecr.io"
DOCKER_FILE_NAME="Dockerfile"
DOCKER_PUSH="false"
VERSION="latest"
BASE_URL="http://ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local"
API_BASE_URL="http://ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local/api"
KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL="http://localhost/keycloak"
```

4. Build:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
This command will prepare java libraries for deployment

4. Deploy:
```
sh skaffold-local.sh
```
This script will build docker images and start local kubernetes environment with hot reloading of your code changes

6. Open `http://localhost` and test the app.

- Make sure that Keycloak `Login` and `Register` works, and you are able to `Create Movie Event` and place bet on it.
- You can use credentials: `admin` / `admin` for user with admin privileges and credentials: `user` / `user` for regular user
- Any new user, registered with Keycloak, is automatically assigned regular user privileges
- Optionally, create 2 test accounts by clicking `Register` on the `Keycloak Login` Page, create movie event and place bet with one account and do the same with another account.
- If the winner exists at the move event close time, then the movie event is closed, and the bets start to settle by recursively triggering kafka events during settlement, until all settlement jobs are finished.
- Note: If the winner doesn't exist, then the movie event is configured to be closed later, after configurable amount of time (6ß seconds by default)
- The winner exists only if the movie has more votes than another movie. If the votes are equal, the movie event is extended for configurable duration, until there is a winner.

#### 🎉 Congratulations!

- You successfuly tested `Movie Bets App` locally!


## Azure Production Environment (with Terraform & Skaffold)

1. Create `terraform.auto.tfvars` file in `infra` folder and provide following parameters:

```
kubernetes_version= "1.32.2"
app_name = "{provide_your_own_globally_unique_name}"
location = "westeurope" (use any other azure location, for example, "germanywestcentral", if you have any issues with "westeurope")
```

2. Replace `moviebets` with your own globally unique name (see files `container-registry.tf`, `kubernetes-cluster.tf` and `resource-group.tf`)

3. Login to Azure Cloud with `az login` CLI

4. CD to `infra` folder

5. Run `terraform init`and `terraform apply --auto-approve`

6. After the script is successfully finished, run the following command:

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group {your_app_name} --name {your_app_name}
```

- Make sure that your context is switched from local Kubernetes Cluster to Azure Kubernetes Cluster. If you have Docker Desktop, just open Kubernetes Context and make sure that the name of the context corresponds to your Azure Kubernetes Cluster

6. run `kubectl get pods` and make sure that `kubectl` works correctly and returns 0 resources

7. Login to Azure Container registry with the following command:

```
docker login {login_server}
```

- You can find docker login server, username and password in Azure Cloud (go to Container Registry -> Settings -> Access Keys)

8. In `env` folder create `.env.prod` file and set the following environment variables:

```
CONTAINER_REGISTRY="moviebets.azurecr.io"  (provide your own globally unique container registry)
DOCKER_FILE_NAME="Dockerfile"
DOCKER_PUSH="true"
VERSION="latest"
BASE_URL="https://skycomposer.net" (provide your own domain name, see `Step-05` and notes below for more details)
API_BASE_URL="https://skycomposer.net/api"
KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL="https://skycomposer.net/keycloak"
```

- Make sure you set your own values for CONTAINER_REGISTRY, BASE_URL, API_BASE_URL and KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL (replace `skycomposer.net` with the name of your domain)

9. Register your domain and enable TLS on AKS Ingress with Lestencrypt: https://medium.com/@jainchirag8001/tls-on-aks-ingress-with-letsencrypt-f42d65725a3
- Make sure you provide your email for CA cluster issuer in `k8s/cert/cluser-issuer.yml` Kubernetes resource (see more details in the article)
- You can find production Ingress Kubernetes Resource in `k8s/prod/ingress-srv.yaml`. This resource will be applied with `sh skaffold-prod.sh` script. Make sure that you replaced `skycomposer.net` with your registered domain name
- When you run `sh skaffold-prod.sh`, you will also install ingress controller and letsencrypt kubernetes resources, described in the article, see the details in `scripts/prod/prepare-k8s.sh` file


10. run `sh skaffold-prod.sh`

- This script will build docker images, push them to azure container registry and deploy images to production kubernetes cluster with hot reloading of your code changes

11. Run `kubectl get pods` and make sure that all containers are RUNNING

12. Edit ingress `cm-acme-http-solver`, as described in the article: https://medium.com/@jainchirag8001/tls-on-aks-ingress-with-letsencrypt-f42d65725a3
13. Verify that certificate `tls-secret` is working (Ready = True, see the article for more details)

14. Open https url with your registered domain in your Browser and make sure that Keycloak `Login` and `Register` works, you are able to `Create a Movie Event` and place a bet on it

- Optionally, register 2 new users, create movie event with one account and place bet with another account
- The only difference between `skaffold dev` and `skaffold run` is that `skaffold dev` allows hot reloading of your code changes on production! Try to make any code change with your IDE and you will immediately see this change on production!
- If you run `sh skaffold-local.sh` or `sh skaffold-prod.sh` you will see logs in real-time. After closing the cli window, all kubernetes resources will be destroyed! Therefore, in order to deploy final changes to production, replace `skaffold dev` with `skaffold run` in the `skaffold-prod.sh` script. You will not have hot reloading with `skaffold run` anymore, but kubernetes resources will not be destroyed after you close cli window.

#### 🎉 Congratulations!

- You successfully tested `Moive Bets App` in production!

## Github Actions Deployment Pipeline Setup

1. Create the following Github Secrets (Go to Your Repository -> Settings -> Secrets and Variables -> Actions -> New Repository Secret):

```
CONTAINER_REGISTRY=... (Azure Container Registry)
KUBE_CONFIG=.. (Base64 encoded  ~/.kube/config file contents)
REGISTRY_UN=... (Azure Container Registry Username)
REGISTRY_PW=... (Azure Container Registry Password)
```

- You can find values for CONTAINER_REGISTRY, REGISTRY_UN and REGISTRY_PW in Azure Cloud (go to Container Registry -> Settings -> Access Keys)
- You can get the value of KUBE_CONFIG with this command `cat ~/.kube/config | base64` (make sure you switched context to Azure Production Kubernetes Cluster before running this command!)

2. Make any code changes (for example change `SkyComposer` to `SkyComposer 2` in `moviebets-ui/components/header.js` file)

3. Push changes with `git add .`, `git commit -m "test changes"` and `git push origin`

4. Go to "Your repository -> Actions" and make sure that the Deployment Pipeline is automatically started and successfully finished

- This pipeline will build changed docker image, push it to container registry and deploy changed image with new version to kubernetes cluster

5. Open https link for your registered domain in your Browser and make sure that you can see `SkyComposer 2` title on the top left

#### 🎉 Congratulations!

- You successfully tested `Movie Bets App` code changes with Github Actions Deployment Pipeline!
